# Data Professionals Survey Report with Power BI

Using an Excel sheet containing survey responses from data professionals, I transformed the raw data into clear, easy-to-understand visualizations and reports with Power BI. After cleaning and transforming the data, I created precise, targeted insights that help organizations and stakeholders make informed decisions. 💡

The report covers key insights, including:

📈 Total number of data professionals
🧑‍💻 Average age and role breakdown
💻 Favorite programming languages
💼 Satisfaction scores for work and salary
⚖️ Gender distribution

With Power BI, I was able to break down complex data into simple, understandable visualizations, providing valuable insights to support better decision-making. 🚀
